# Students_Marks_Predictor_Web_App
This repository contains a Student Marks Pred, developed using Flask for the backend and basic HTML/CSS for the frontend. The application leverages a machine learning algorithm to predict student marks based on input features.I focused on implementing the Flask server, enabling seamless interaction between the user interface and the machine.
